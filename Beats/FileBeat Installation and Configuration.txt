Beats are a collection of lightweight and open source log shippers that act as agents installed on the different servers in your infrastructure for collecting logs or metrics.
These can be log files (Filebeat), network data (Packetbeat), server metrics (Metricbeat), or any other type of data.
One of the facts that make Filebeat so efficient is the way it handles backpressure—so if Logstash is busy, Filebeat slows down it’s read rate and picks up the beat once the slowdown is over.


**Installing Beats on Linux
    Download and install the Elasticsearch signing key:
    wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -

    Save the repository definition:
    echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/6.x-prerelease/aptstable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-6.x.list

    Install Beat:
    sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install <beatname>

**Installing Beats on Windows
    Try downloading windows version of logstash from download page of https://www.elastic.co/downloads/beats/filebeat



**Configuring filebeat
Filebeat Configuration file is filebeat.yml
The configuration file will include two main sections: one defines what data to collect and how to handle it, the other where to send the data to.  

**Example of a very basic Filebeat configuration:

filebeat.prospectors:
- type: log
  enabled: true
  paths:
    - /var/log/*.log
  fields:
    app_id: service-a
    env: dev
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"]

  **ُStart FileBeat
    Linux: sudo service filebeat start
    Windows: filebeat.exe -e
